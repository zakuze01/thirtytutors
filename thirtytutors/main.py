"""
FastAPI app entrypoint: static/template setup, middleware, and router
wiring. Route logic itself lives in routes_pages.py (page shells),
routes_api.py (reference-data + profile/conversation REST), and
live_session.py (the Gemini Live API relay + /ws/session websocket) -
see those modules for behavior notes.

Run (after `pip install thirtytutors`):
    thirtytutors
Then open:
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/

For local development against a live source checkout, use `pip install -e .`
first so the thirtytutors command runs against this tree directly.
